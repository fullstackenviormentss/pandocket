# Pennsylvania Emancipation Law of 1780

> During and after the American Revolution, Northern states began passing gradual emancipation laws. One of the first such laws was passed by Pennsylvania in 1780.

Pennsylvania - An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery, 1780

*SECTION 1.* WHEN we contemplate our abhorrence of that condition to
which the arms and tyranny of Great Britain were exerted to reduce us;
when we look back on the variety of dangers to which we have been
expofed, and how miraculously our wants in many inftances have been
fupplied, and our deliverances wrought, when even hope and human
fortitude have become unequal to the conflict; we are unavoidably led to
a ferious and grateful fence of the manifold bleffings which we have
undeservedly received from the hand of that Being from whom every good
and perfect gift cometh. Impreffed with there ideas, we conceive that it
is our duty, and we rejoice that it is in our power to extend a portion
of that freedom to others, which hath been extended to us; and a releafe
from that state of thraldom to which we ourfelves were tyrannically
doomed, and from which we have now every profpect of being delivered. It
is not for us to enquire why, in the creation of mankind, the
inhabitants of the feveral parts of the earth were diftinguifhed by a
difference in feature or complexion. It is fufficient to know that all
are the work of an Almighty Hand. We find in the distribution of the
human fpecies, that the moft fertile as well as the moft barren parts of
the earth are inhabited by men of complexions different from ours, and
from each other; from whence we may reasonably, as well as religiously,
infer, that He who placed them in their various situations, hath
extended equally his care and protection to all, and that it becometh
not us to counteract his mercies. We efteem it a peculiar bleffing
granted to us, that we are enabled this day to add one more ftep to
univerfal civilization, by removing as much as poffible the forrows of
thofe w ho have lived in undeferved bondage, and from which, by the
assumed authority of the kings of Great Britain, no effectual, legal
relief could be obtained. Weaned by a long courfe of experience from
thofe narrower prejudices and partialities we had imbibed, we find our
hearts enlarged with kindness and benevolence towards men of all
conditions and nations; and we conceive ourfelves at this particular
period extraordinarily called upon, by the bleffings which we have
received, to manifeft the fincerity of our profeffion, and to give a
Substantial proof of our gratitude.

*SECT. 2.* And whereas the condition of thofe perfons who have
heretofore been denominated Negro and Mulatto flaves, has been attended
with circumftances which not only deprived them of the common bleffings
that they were by nature entitled to, but has caft them into the deepeft
afflictions, by an unnatural feparation and fale of hufband and wife
from each other and from their children; an injury, the greatnefs of
which can only be conceived by fuppofing that we were in the fame
unhappy cafe. In juftice therefore to perfons So unhappily
circumftanced, and who, having no profpect before them whereon they may
reft their forrows and their hopes, have no reasonable inducement to
render their fervice to fociety, which they otherwise might; and also in
grateful commemoration of our own happy deliverance from that ftate of
unconditional fubmiffion to which we were doomed by the tyranny of
Britain.

*SECT. 3.* Be it enacted, and it is hereby enacted, by the
reprefentatives of the freeman of the commonwealth of Pennfylvania, in

[](print_friendly.php?page=transcript&doc=8&title=Transcript+of+Northwest+Ordinance+%281787%29)

**An Ordinance for the government of the Territory of the United States
northwest of the River Ohio.**

**Section 1.** Be it ordained by the United States in Congress
assembled, That the said territory, for the purposes of temporary
government, be one district, subject, however, to be divided into two
districts, as future circumstances may, in the opinion of Congress, make
it expedient.

**Sec 2.** Be it ordained by the authority aforesaid, That the estates,
both of resident and nonresident proprietors in the said territory,
dying intestate, shall descent to, and be distributed among their
children, and the descendants of a deceased child, in equal parts; the
descendants of a deceased child or grandchild to take the share of their
deceased parent in equal parts among them: And where there shall be no
children or descendants, then in equal parts to the next of kin in equal
degree; and among collaterals, the children of a deceased brother or
sister of the intestate shall have, in equal parts among them, their
deceased parents' share; and there shall in no case be a distinction
between kindred of the whole and half blood; saving, in all cases, to
the widow of the intestate her third part of the real estate for life,
and one third part of the personal estate; and this law relative to
descents and dower, shall remain in full force until altered by the
legislature of the district. And until the governor and judges shall
adopt laws as hereinafter mentioned, estates in the said territory may
be devised or bequeathed by wills in writing, signed and sealed by him
or her in whom the estate may be (being of full age), and attested by
three witnesses; and real estates may be conveyed by lease and release,
or bargain and sale, signed, sealed and delivered by the person being of
full age, in whom the estate may be, and attested by two witnesses,
provided such wills be duly proved, and such conveyances be
acknowledged, or the execution thereof duly proved, and be recorded
within one year after proper magistrates, courts, and registers shall be
appointed for that purpose; and personal property may be transferred by
delivery; saving, however to the French and Canadian inhabitants, and
other settlers of the Kaskaskies, St. Vincents and the neighboring
villages who have heretofore professed themselves citizens of Virginia,

and conveyance, of property.

**Sec. 3.** Be it ordained by the authority aforesaid, That there shall
be appointed from time to time by Congress, a governor, whose commission

secretary, whose commission shall continue in force for four years
unless sooner revoked; he shall reside in the district, and have a
freehold estate therein in 500 acres of land, while in the exercise of
his office. It shall be his duty to keep and preserve the acts and laws
passed by the legislature, and the public records of the district, and
the proceedings of the governor in his executive department, and
transmit authentic copies of such acts and proceedings, every six
months, to the Secretary of Congress: There shall also be appointed a
court to consist of three judges, any two of whom to form a court, who

during good behavior.

**Sec. 5.**The governor and judges, or a majority of them, shall adopt
and publish in the district such laws of the original States, criminal
and civil, as may be necessary and best suited to the circumstances of
the district, and report them to Congress from time to time: which laws
shall be in force in the district until the organization of the General
Assembly therein, unless disapproved of by Congress; but afterwards the
Legislature shall have authority to alter them as they shall think fit.

**Sec. 6.** The governor, for the time being, shall be commander in
chief of the militia, appoint and commission all officers in the same
below the rank of general officers; all general officers shall be
appointed and commissioned by Congress.

**Sec. 7.** Previous to the organization of the general assembly, the
governor shall appoint such magistrates and other civil officers in each
county or township, as he shall find necessary for the preservation of
the peace and good order in the same: After the general assembly shall
be organized, the powers and duties of the magistrates and other civil
officers shall be regulated and defined by the said assembly; but all
magistrates and other civil officers not herein otherwise directed,
shall during the continuance of this temporary government, be appointed
by the governor.

**Sec. 8.** For the prevention of crimes and injuries, the laws to be
adopted or made shall have force in all parts of the district, and for
the execution of process, criminal and civil, the governor shall make
proper divisions thereof; and he shall proceed from time to time as
circumstances may require, to lay out the parts of the district in which
the Indian titles shall have been extinguished, into counties and
townships, subject, however, to such alterations as may thereafter be
made by the legislature.

**Sec. 9.** So soon as there shall be five thousand free male
inhabitants of full age in the district, upon giving proof thereof to
the governor, they shall receive authority, with time and place, to
elect a representative from their counties or townships to represent
them in the general assembly: Provided, That, for every five hundred
free male inhabitants, there shall be one representative, and so on
progressively with the number of free male inhabitants shall the right
of representation increase, until the number of representatives shall
amount to twenty five; after which, the number and proportion of
representatives shall be regulated by the legislature: Provided, That no
person be eligible or qualified to act as a representative unless he
shall have been a citizen of one of the United States three years, and
be a resident in the district, or unless he shall have resided in the
district three years; and, in either case, shall likewise hold in his
own right, in fee simple, two hundred acres of land within the same;
Provided, also, That a freehold in fifty acres of land in the district,
having been a citizen of one of the states, and being resident in the

of two years; and, in case of the death of a representative, or removal
from office, the governor shall issue a writ to the county or township
for which he was a member, to elect another in his stead, to serve for
the residue of the term.

appoint and commission to serve as aforesaid; and, whenever a vacancy
shall happen in the council, by death or removal from office, the house
of representatives shall nominate two persons, qualified as aforesaid,
for each vacancy, and return their names to Congress; one of whom

every five years, four months at least before the expiration of the time
of service of the members of council, the said house shall nominate ten
persons, qualified as aforesaid, and return their names to Congress;
five of whom Congress shall appoint and commission to serve as members
of the council five years, unless sooner removed. And the governor,
legislative council, and house of representatives, shall have authority
to make laws in all cases, for the good government of the district, not
repugnant to the principles and articles in this ordinance established
and declared. And all bills, having passed by a majority in the house,
and by a majority in the council, shall be referred to the governor for

ballot, to elect a delegate to Congress, who shall have a seat in
Congress, with a right of debating but not voting during this temporary
government.

**Sec. 13.** And, for extending the fundamental principles of civil and
religious liberty, which form the basis whereon these republics, their
laws and constitutions are erected; to fix and establish those
principles as the basis of all laws, constitutions, and governments,
which forever hereafter shall be formed in the said territory: to
provide also for the establishment of States, and permanent government
therein, and for their admission to a share in the federal councils on
an equal footing with the original States, at as early periods as may be
consistent with the general interest:

**Sec. 14.** It is hereby ordained and declared by the authority
aforesaid, That the following articles shall be considered as articles
of compact between the original States and the people and States in the
said territory and forever remain unalterable, unless by common consent,
to wit:

**Art. 1.** No person, demeaning himself in a peaceable and orderly
manner, shall ever be molested on account of his mode of worship or
religious sentiments, in the said territory.

**Art. 2.** The inhabitants of the said territory shall always be
entitled to the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus, and of the trial
by jury; of a proportionate representation of the people in the
legislature; and of judicial proceedings according to the course of the
common law. All persons shall be bailable, unless for capital offenses,
where the proof shall be evident or the presumption great. All fines
shall be moderate; and no cruel or unusual punishments shall be
inflicted. No man shall be deprived of his liberty or property, but by
the judgment of his peers or the law of the land; and, should the public
exigencies make it necessary, for the common preservation, to take any
person's property, or to demand his particular services, full
compensation shall be made for the same. And, in the just preservation
of rights and property, it is understood and declared, that no law ought
ever to be made, or have force in the said territory, that shall, in any
manner whatever, interfere with or affect private contracts or
engagements, bona fide, and without fraud, previously formed.

**Art. 3.** Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good
government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of
education shall forever be encouraged. The utmost good faith shall
always be observed towards the Indians; their lands and property shall
never be taken from them without their consent; and, in their property,
rights, and liberty, they shall never be invaded or disturbed, unless in
just and lawful wars authorized by Congress; but laws founded in justice
and humanity, shall from time to time be made for preventing wrongs
being done to them, and for preserving peace and friendship with them.

**Art. 4.** The said territory, and the States which may be formed
therein, shall forever remain a part of this Confederacy of the United
States of America, subject to the Articles of Confederation, and to such
alterations therein as shall be constitutionally made; and to all the
acts and ordinances of the United States in Congress assembled,
conformable thereto. The inhabitants and settlers in the said territory
shall be subject to pay a part of the federal debts contracted or to be
contracted, and a proportional part of the expenses of government, to be
apportioned on them by Congress according to the same common rule and
measure by which apportionments thereof shall be made on the other
States; and the taxes for paying their proportion shall be laid and
levied by the authority and direction of the legislatures of the
district or districts, or new States, as in the original States, within
the time agreed upon by the United States in Congress assembled. The
legislatures of those districts or new States, shall never interfere
with the primary disposal of the soil by the United States in Congress
assembled, nor with any regulations Congress may find necessary for
securing the title in such soil to the bona fide purchasers. No tax
shall be imposed on lands the property of the United States; and, in no
case, shall nonresident proprietors be taxed higher than residents. The
navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence, and the
carrying places between the same, shall be common highways and forever
free, as well to the inhabitants of the said territory as to the
citizens of the United States, and those of any other States that may be
admitted into the confederacy, without any tax, impost, or duty
therefor.

**Art. 5.** There shall be formed in the said territory, not less than
three nor more than five States; and the boundaries of the States, as
soon as Virginia shall alter her act of cession, and consent to the
same, shall become fixed and established as follows, to wit: The western
State in the said territory, shall be bounded by the Mississippi, the
Ohio, and Wabash Rivers; a direct line drawn from the Wabash and Post
Vincents, due North, to the territorial line between the United States
and Canada; and, by the said territorial line, to the Lake of the Woods
and Mississippi. The middle State shall be bounded by the said direct
line, the Wabash from Post Vincents to the Ohio, by the Ohio, by a
direct line, drawn due north from the mouth of the Great Miami, to the
said territorial line, and by the said territorial line. The eastern
State shall be bounded by the last mentioned direct line, the Ohio,
Pennsylvania, and the said territorial line: Provided, however, and it
is further understood and declared, that the boundaries of these three
States shall be subject so far to be altered, that, if Congress shall
hereafter find it expedient, they shall have authority to form one or
two States in that part of the said territory which lies north of an
east and west line drawn through the southerly bend or extreme of Lake
Michigan. And, whenever any of the said States shall have sixty thousand
free inhabitants therein, such State shall be admitted, by its
delegates, into the Congress of the United States, on an equal footing
with the original States in all respects whatever, and shall be at
liberty to form a permanent constitution and State government: Provided,
the constitution and government so to be formed, shall be republican,
and in conformity to the principles contained in these articles; and, so
far as it can be consistent with the general interest of the
confederacy, such admission shall be allowed at an earlier period, and
when there may be a less number of free inhabitants in the State than
sixty thousand.

**Art. 6.** There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in
the said territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof
the party shall have been duly convicted: Provided, always, That any
person escaping into the same, from whom labor or service is lawfully
claimed in any one of the original States, such fugitive may be lawfully
reclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or
service as aforesaid.

Be it ordained by the authority aforesaid, That the resolutions of the
23rd of April, 1784, relative to the subject of this ordinance, be, and
the same are hereby repealed and declared null and void.

Done by the United States, in Congress assembled, the 13th day of July,
in the year of our Lord 1787, and of their soveriegnty and independence
the twelfth.

2. Which territories would be covered by the Proviso if it had been passed?

The Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation
=========================================

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:

A PROCLAMATION.

I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States of America, and
commander-in-chief of the army and navy thereof, do hereby proclaim and
declare that hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be prosecuted for
the object of practically restoring the constitutional relation between
the United States and each of the states and the people thereof, in
which states that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed.

That it is my purpose, upon the next meeting of Congress, to again
recommend the adoption of a practical measure tendering pecuniary aid to
the free acceptance or rejection of all slave states, so called, the
people whereof may not then be in rebellion against the United States,
and which states may then have voluntarily adopted, or thereafter may
voluntarily adopt, immediate or gradual abolishment of slavery within
their respective limits; and that the effort to colonize persons of
African descent with their consent upon this continent or elsewhere,
with the previously obtained consent of the governments existing there,
will be continued.

That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand
eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any
state or designated part of a state, the people whereof shall then be in
rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and
forever free; and the Executive Government of the United States,
including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and
maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to
repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for
their actual freedom.

That the Executive will, on the first day of January aforesaid, by
proclamation, designate the states and parts of states, if any, in which
the people thereof, respectively, shall then be in rebellion against the
United States; and the fact that any State, or the people thereof, shall
on that day be, in good faith, represented in the Congress of the United
States by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the
qualified voters of such state shall have participated, shall, in the
absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive
evidence that such state, and the people thereof, are not then in
rebellion against the United States.

That attention is hereby called to an act of Congress entitled “An act
to make an additional article of war,” approved March 13, 1862, and
which act is in the words and figure following:

“*Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled*, That hereafter the following
shall be promulgated as an additional article of war, for the government
of the army of the United States, and shall be obeyed and observed as
such:

“ARTICLE –. All officers or persons in the military or naval service of
the United States are prohibited from employing any of the forces under
their respective commands for the purpose of returning fugitives from
service or labor who may have escaped from any persons to whom such
service or labor is claimed to be due, and any officer who shall be
found guilty by a court-martial of violating this article shall be
dismissed from the service.

“SEC. 2. *And be it further enacted*, That this act shall take effect
from and after its passage.”

Also to the ninth and tenth sections of an act entitled “An act to
suppress insurrection, to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and
confiscate property of rebels, and for other purposes,” approved July
17, 1862, and which sections are in the words and figures following:

“SEC 9. *And be it further enacted*, That all slaves of persons who
shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the Government of the
United States, or who shall in any way give aid or comfort thereto,
escaping from such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the
army; and all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them, and
coming under the control of the Government of the United States; and all
slaves of such persons found *on* [or] being within any place occupied
by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by the forces of the United
States, shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of
their servitude, and not again held as slaves.

SEC. 10. *And be it further enacted*, That no slaves escaping into any
state, territory, or the District of Columbia, from any other state,
shall be delivered up, or in any way impeded or hindered of his liberty,
except for crime, or some offence against the laws, unless the person
claiming said fugitive shall first make oath that the person to whom the
labor or service of such fugitive is alleged to be due is his lawful
owner, and has not borne arms against the United States in the present
rebellion, nor in any way given aid and comfort thereto; and no person
engaged in the military or naval service of the United States shall,
under any pretence whatever, assume to decide on the validity of the
claim of any person to the service or labor of any other person, or
surrender up any such person to the claimant, on pain of being dismissed
from the service.”

And I do hereby enjoin upon and order all persons engaged in the
military and naval service of the United States to observe, obey, and
enforce, within their respective spheres of service, the act and
sections above recited.

And the Executive will in due time recommend that all citizens of the
United States who shall have remained loyal thereto throughout the
rebellion shall (upon the restoration of the constitutional relation
between the United States and their respective states and people, if
that relation shall have been suspended or disturbed) be compensated for
all losses by acts of the United States, including the loss of slaves.

In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of
the United States to be affixed.

Done at the city of Washington this twenty-second day of September, in
the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, and of
the Independence of the United States the eighty-seventh.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

By the President: 
 WILLIAM H. SEWARD, *Secretary of State*.
